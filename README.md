## Eric's Daily Harvest assignment

**Instructions:**

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Clone this repo
- Open a command/shell prompt and go in to this project/repo directory
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you have yarn
- Run `npm install gulp-cli -g`
- Run `gulp start` to start the application server
- You can then test the API directly by going to http://localhost:6789/search?ingredient_name=Organic%20Banana
- Or test it by accessing the (extremely basic) HTML page with a search function http://localhost:6789/
- You can run `npm test` to run a few unit tests for the API
